# YT Audio Downloader for Chrome
Chrome extension to download audio from YouTube video.


This is a simple way to run a [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) command directly from a video page.  
[youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) is not included, you should install it and make it runnable through command line. 

Run [install_host.bat](./install_host.bat) to allow windows to handle message received from the extension.

Files will be downloaded into a `downloads` folder, located in the root directory.
